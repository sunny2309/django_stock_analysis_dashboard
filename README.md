# Django Stock Analysis Dashboard

The codebase contains the code of a stock analysis dashboard created using **Django** and **[Amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com)**. 

Django is Python web-framework and Amcharts is a famous javascript library for creating interactive data visualizations.

For retrieving stock data, I have used the Python library **[yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)**.

The app's layout is created using the frontend framework **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**.

I have recorded a YouTube video that explains the codebase in detail. Here's a link to it.

Please feel free to extend the dashboard by adding new functionalities.
